# MCP Installation

`stock-sdk`'s MCP server talks to clients over **stdio**, and the launch command is always `stock-sdk mcp`. In each AI client you simply register it as a stdio-type MCP server.

The examples below launch via `npx` (no pre-install needed; `-y` skips the interactive prompt):

```jsonc
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "stock-sdk", "mcp"]
}
```

> You can also `npm install -g stock-sdk` first, then set `command` to `"stock-sdk"` and `args` to `["mcp"]`, saving the `npx` resolution cost on each start.

## Cursor

Create/edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (or the global config dir):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock-sdk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "stock-sdk", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, enable `stock-sdk` in Cursor's MCP settings to call the market-data tools in chat.

## Claude Desktop

Edit the Claude Desktop config file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock-sdk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "stock-sdk", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, **restart Claude Desktop**; the `stock-sdk` tool icon should appear in the toolbar.

## Codex

Add a server entry to Codex's MCP config (TOML):

```toml
[mcp_servers.stock-sdk]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "stock-sdk", "mcp"]
```

## Gemini

Add `mcpServers` to the Gemini CLI `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock-sdk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "stock-sdk", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify the connection

The server uses stdio and is normally spawned by the client — no need to run it by hand. To manually confirm it starts in a terminal:

```bash
npx -y stock-sdk mcp
```

The process waits for JSON-RPC messages (such as `initialize`) on stdin. Once a client is connected, ask the model to "list available tools" to confirm the handshake succeeded.

> Config file paths and field names may vary across client versions — follow each client's official docs. This page only fixes the `stock-sdk mcp` launch entry.
